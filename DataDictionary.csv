ColumnName,Type,Include,Unit,Definition
des,result,0,,a brief text description of the result of the pitch
id,id,0,,a unique identification number per pitch within a game; numbers increment by one for each pitch but are not consecutive between at bats
type,result,0,,"a one-letter abbreviation for the result of the pitch: B, ball; S strike (including fouls); X in play"
x,,0,,the horizontal location of the pitch as it crossed home plate as input by the Gameday stringer using the old Gameday coordinate system
y,,0,,the vertical location of the pitch as it crossed home plate as input by the Gameday stringer using the old Gameday coordinate system
start_speed,speed,1,mph,the pitch speed in three dimensions measured at the initial point y0
end_speed,speed,1,mph,the pitch speed measured as it crossed the front of home plate
sz_top,3d-space,1,ft,the distance from the ground to the top of the current batter's rulebook strike zone as measured from the video by the PITCHf/x operator
sz_bot,3d-space,1,ft,the distance from the ground to the bottom of the current batter's rulebook strike zone; the PITCHf/x operator sets a line at the hollow of the knee for the bottom of the zone
pfx_x,movement,1,in,the horizontal movement of the pitch between the release point and home plate as compared to a theoretical pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin-induced movement this parameter is measured at y=40 feet regardless of the y0 value
pfx_z,movement,1,in,the vertical movement of the pitch between the release point and home plate as compared to a theoretical pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin-induced movement; this parameter is measured at y=40 feet regardless of the y0 value
px,3d-space,1,ft,the left/right distance of the pitch from the middle of the plate as it crossed home plate; the PITCHf/x coordinate system is oriented to the catcher's/umpire's perspective with distances to the right being positive and to the left being negative
pz,3d-space,1,ft,the height of the pitch as it crossed the front of home plate
x0,trajectory,1,ft,the left/right distance of the pitch measured at the initial point
y0,trajectory,1,ft,the distance in feet from home plate where the PITCHf/x system is set to measure the initial parameters
z0,trajectory,1,ft,the height of the pitch measured at the initial point
vx0,trajectory,1,ft/s,the velocity of the pitch in the x-direction measured at the initial point
vy0,trajectory,1,ft/s,the velocity of the pitch in the y-direction measured at the initial point
vz0,trajectory,1,ft/s,the velocity of the pitch in the z-direction measured at the initial point
ax,trajectory,1,ft/s^2,the acceleration of the pitch in the x-direction measured at the initial point
ay,trajectory,1,ft/s^2,the acceleration of the pitch in the y-direction measured at the initial point
az,trajectory,1,ft/s^2,the acceleration of the pitch in the z-direction measured at the initial point
break_y,trajectory,1,ft,the distance from home plate to the point in the pitch trajectory where the pitch achieved its greatest deviation from the straight line path between the release point and the front of home plate
break_angle,trajectory,1,deg,the angle from vertical to the straight line path from the release point to where the pitch crossed the front of home plate as seen from the catcher's/umpire's perspective
break_length,trajectory,1,in,the measurement of the greatest distance between the trajectory of the pitch at any point between the release point and the front of home plate and the straight line path from the release point and the front of home plate
sv_id,id,0,,a date/time stamp of when the PITCHf/x tracking system first detected the pitch in the air; it is in the format YYMMDD_hhmmss
pitch_type,class,0,,the most probable pitch type according to a neural net classification algorithm developed by Ross Paul of MLBAM
type_confidence,class,0,,the value of the weight at the classification algorithm's output node corresponding to the most probable pitch type this value is multiplied by a factor of 1.5 if the pitch is known by MLBAM to be part of the pitcher's repertoire
